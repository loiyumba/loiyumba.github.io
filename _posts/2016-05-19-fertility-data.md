Fertility data is available on Govt. census [portal](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.html), but I have 
never tried to look at it until this article was published on [kanglaonline](http://kanglaonline.com/2016/05/manipuri-women-infertility-suspected-on-food/).
Some of the comments rejected the claim made by the article. Since the article is not supported by data, the claim made by the article
is weak as per by some of the comments. I have some female friends who got married at early 30's and some of them did have some problem
conceiving and some of them didn't have any problem. I didn't know the conceiving problem is at large scale in my state - Manipur as pointed
by the article. I will not know the causes of infertility as pointed by the article which says it may be because of many factors which include
our food habit like eating fermented fish and dried fish. If we look at the present scenario, not just infertility, overall health is impacting
because of food adulteration, all type of pollutions and stressfull lifestyle. What I can know is how large the infertility problem is in
Manipur. So I thought of looking at the 2011 census data on fertility. At least, data will show some insights. I will compare fertility data
of Manipur with some other states with almost equal women population. I found women population of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura
share the number closer than any other state. Nagaland's women population is less than Manipur's while Meghalaya's and Tripura's women
population is more.   

Here's the table derived from the census data   

| State | Total women | Total married women | Total married women with no Child |

| Manipur   |  14,17,208    |    6,87,039           |       1,18,454                  |
| Nagaland  |   9,53,853     |   4,00,850           |         56,482                  |
| Meghalaya |  14,75,057    |    6,57,702           |        1,11,646                 |
| Tripura   |  17,99,541    |   10,78,931          |        1,25,235                 |
