Fertility data is available on Govt. census [portal](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.html), but I have 
never tried to look at it until this article was published on [kanglaonline](http://kanglaonline.com/2016/05/manipuri-women-infertility-suspected-on-food/).
Some of the comments rejected the claim made by the article. Since the article is not supported by data, the claim made by the article
is weak as per some of the comments. I have some female friends who got married at early 30's and some of them did have some problem
conceiving and some of them didn't have any problem. I didn't know the infertility problem is at large scale in my state - Manipur as pointed
by the article. I will not know the causes of infertility as pointed by the article which says it may be because of many factors which include
our food habit like eating fermented fish and dried fish. If we look at the present scenario, not just infertility, overall health is impacted
because of food adulteration, all type of pollutions and stressfull lifestyle. What I can know is how large the infertility problem is in
Manipur. So I thought of looking at the 2011 census data on fertility. At least, data will show some insights. I will compare fertility data
of Manipur with some other states with almost equal women population. This way we will know where Manipur stands in fertility compare to these states. I found women population of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura
share the number closer to Manipur's women population than any other state. Nagaland's women population is less than Manipur's while Meghalaya's and Tripura's women
population are more.   

Here is the filtered table of four states from 2011 census data -   

| State | Total women | Total married women | Total married women with no Child |   
| ---   |---          |---                  |---                                |
| Manipur   |  14,17,208    |    6,87,039           |       1,18,454                  |
| Nagaland  |   9,53,853     |   4,00,850           |         56,482                  |
| Meghalaya |  14,75,057    |    6,57,702           |        1,11,646                 |
| Tripura   |  17,99,541    |   10,78,931          |        1,25,235                 |     

We can check the difference of 'Total married women' and 'Total married women with no child' for each state by percentage. This will tell us which state is highest in fertility rate and which state is not. We simply do    

> % of Total married women = Total married women / Total women    
> % of Total married women with no child = Total married women with no child / Total married women    

Here is the calculated percentage table -    

| State    | % of married women  | % of married women with no child |
| ---      | ---                 | ---                              |
| Manipur  | 48.47               |   17.24                          |
| Nagaland | 42.02               |   14.09                          |
| Meghalaya| 44.58               |   16.97                          |
| Tripura  | 59.95               |   11.60                          |  

From the above table, we can easily point out that percentage of married women with no child in Manipur is highest among the four states which do inform us that infertility is indeed high in our state. Lets break down the data further by age group for all the states. The original data categorize the ages of women into few age categories like "less than 15", "15-19", "20-24" and so on. It's understandable if a married woman whose age is less than 20 years doesn't have a child. So better to check the number of women whose age is 20 years and above with no child. Again, we cannot conclude entirely these total number of childless married women is by-choice childless or not, specially younger married women. Lets see the table first to understand better. The columns from Age to 0 child is from the original data. I have added two new columns `% of married women` and `% of married women with no child` for each age interval like I have done in the above table.

60-64  |   35,330     |  34,315        |   3,468   |       97           |             10
65-69  |   23,430     |  22,680        |   2,460   |       97           |             10
70-74  |   17,477     |  17,056        |   2,081   |       97           |             12 
75-79  |   10,765     |  10,533        |   1,420   |       98           |             13
80+    |   13,233     |  12,472        |   1,994   |       94           |             16     

From the above table what we have noticed is the percentage of married women without child is highest among age range 20-24, followed by age range 25-29, and gradually this decreases with increasing age range. Age 20-22 can be safely assumed as planned for not having child, but later than this age range is left with some questions as posted in the article. Do couples in Manipur age range 23-29
really suffer from infertility. The data say so! Some couples may have planned to delay having child, still percentage should not be this high. We will know how other three states are doing from the below tables.

To further summarise, I will sum the numbers of Total women, Married women and 0 child from age range 20-34 i.e. the first three age ranges and calculate the percentage once again. This age ranges are the prime age for fertility. And whichever state come up with high percentage could mean only one thing - warning of infertility.   

State  |  Age  | Total women | Married women | 0 child | % of married women | % of married women with no child
------ |-------|-------------|---------------|---------|--------------------|---------------------------------
Manipur | 20-34 | 3,91,060     | 2,32,288         | 59,728  |     59             |          26       
Nagaland| 20-34 | 2,61,316     | 1,51,569         | 31,997  |     58             |          21   
Meghalaya| 20-34 | 3,66,348    | 2,74,195         | 53,672  |     75             |          20    
Tripura | 20-34 | 4,96,246     | 4,13,806         | 60,627  |     83             |          15       

As expected, Manipur is highest in infertility among the four states and Tripura is doing best. 83% women are married between age 20-34 and women with no child is only 15% in Tripura.   

Lets check for the entire northeast states. Instead of putting up dull looking table again and again, I will show the data in plot. The plot will interpret the number at first glance.
