The north-eastern part of India has seen insurgency uprising since Independence of India. Before British took over the entire northeast
India, some of the states were kingdom and rest of the places unexplored, inhabited by tribals population. After British left, India took
over the entire northeast India one by one. Before India took over and British left, these places were independent. Some of the places were
taken forcefully, some places even had a war like situation, for some transitions were smooth. Most of the people are not worried about
this because for general masses, earning a livelihood is what matter most. However, some are not happy about it and become revolutionary
or insurgent working towards achieving independence from India. They form groups, took up arms and fight against govt. Now, many decades
have been passed but till today there is no solution to it. It's been going on. With time, things have changed, leaders have changed so the
agenda and mission also changed. It's more of politics now. That's my personal opinion.       

I am trying to tell a story via data visualization. Because of the insurgency problem in the entire northeast, the people living in this
region is paying a high price in terms of human lives, development, education, economy, healthcare, etc. The number of fatalities due to
insurgency is high. The casualties are on all sides - the civilians, security personnels and insurgents. Let's see how this has been going
on for the last 10 years through data visualizations.     

Data is scrapped from [SATP](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/fatalitiesnorteast2006.htm) and the cleaned data is
stored [here](https://github.com/loiyumba/Dataset/tree/master/NEinsurgency). 

Let's look at the civilians killed in the last 10 years because of insurgency. I have categorised by statewise.
