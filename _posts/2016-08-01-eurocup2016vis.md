Euro Cup 2016
-------
The group matches are not exciting to me. What excites me is the knock-out games! I started watching Euro Cup 2016 from quarter finals. 
Due to different time zone, we always have to stay awake almost all night to watch the game. I predicted Germany to win this Euro Cup,
however they were defeated by France. All my friends were predicting France to win the final, and looking at the game, it was obvious France 
will win. France played brilliantly but they just couldn't score a goal to take away the cup. I would say that night, lady luck was sitting on
Portugal.   

Apart from games, I was also interested in game statistics. I have waited for the tournament to get over so that I can see the final statistics.  

Getting and Cleaning Data
--------
The data is posted on official UEFA  [site](http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/statistics/index.html). And to transfer the data table 
posted on the website to R, I have used `rvest` package.    

```r
library(rvest)
```   
And to copy the data table from the site, the code goes like this   

```r
attempts <- read_html("http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/statistics/round=2000448/teams/category=attacking/kind=attempts/index.html")

attemptsData <- attempts %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  html_table()
```   
First, we have to save the url page where the table is displayed. Then using rvest function html_nodes("table") and then .[[1]] for table
1 and then html_table(), we can easily copy the table. In fact, the page has only one table. If there were two tables and we wanted both
then we would have used .[[2]] to transfer table number 2. For more detail, please read `rvest` package info.  

Once the data is successfully transfered to R, we can do some data exploration like   

```r
str(attemptsData)
head(attemptsData)
```      

While looking at the data, I have noticed that some unwanted characters appeared on the Team name column. In order to remove unwanted
character, I have used base R function **substr** and **str_trim** from `stringr` package.    

```r
attemptsData$Name <- substr(attemptsData$Name, 6, 70)
attemptsData$Name <- str_trim(attemptsData$Name, side = "left")
```   

**substr** function removed the first 5 unwanted characters and left with spaces on the left side. While the country/team names are on the right side, I have used **str_trim(, side = "left")** to remove all the spaces on the left which also made other unwanted characters go.    

Once the data is cleaned, I have saved the data in the local disk.  

```r
write.csv(attemptsData, "attempts.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```   

Here is the glimpse of data -   

```r
head(attemptsData)
```

Visualization
---------   

Load the `ggplot2` package.

```r
library(ggplot2)
```

**Basic Bar Plot**     

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = Name, y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```   

[![basic]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/plot1.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/plot1.png)   
From the above ggplot, we can't make out what's in the x-axis. The y-label is not properly named. In order to read the x-axis well, I have flipped the ggplot. I have added **###** to identify the new line of code.    

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = Name, y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() ###
```   

[![flipped]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot2.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot2.png)   

Now we can read the country/team names properly. I want to label the x-axis and y-axis appropriately. X-axis label name "Name", I will keep it empty and y-axis label name to "Attempts". Also, add title to the ggplot.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = Name, y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") + ###
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") ###
```   

[![title]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot3.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot3.png)    

Now I want to display the attempts made by country/team on their respective bar. 

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = Name, y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) + ###
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts")
```    

[![values]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot4.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot4.png)     

Change the colour of bar and remove the grey background. To see the colours available in R, we can run **colors()** in the console and it will display all the colours name.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = Name, y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") + ###
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) + 
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme_bw() ###
```   

[![color]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot5.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot5.png)   

Let's reorder the bar in descending order as per attempts made by country/team. For this we need to manipulate data little bit. We arrange the variable _Total.attempts_ in descending order and also use **reorder()** in ggplot. For arranging _Total.attempts_ in descending order, we will use `dplyr` package. We can also use base function **order()**.

```r
require(dplyr)
attempts <- arrange(attempts, desc(Total.attempts))

ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) + ###
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme_bw()
```   

[![order]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot6.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot6.png)    

Now I want all the grid lines go.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) ###
```   

[![grid]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot7.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot7.png)   

Okay, without the x-axis the plot doesn't look good to me. So I have added an x-axis line with the same colour as bar.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .8, colour = "lavender"), ###
        panel.background = element_blank())
```   

[![axisline]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot8.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot8.png)   

Or, we can draw lines on both axes.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .8, colour = "lavender"),
        axis.line.y = element_line(size = .8, colour = "lavender"), ###
        panel.background = element_blank())
```   

[![axesline]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot9.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot9.png)   

Or, if we don't want lavender colour as axes lines.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .8, colour = "black"), ###
        axis.line.y = element_line(size = .8, colour = "black"), ###
        panel.background = element_blank())
```   

[![axesblack]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot10.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot10.png)    

However, in a bar plot like this, I prefer to have just one axis line and that is x-axis and in black colour.

```r
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .6, colour = "black"), ###
        panel.background = element_blank())
```

[![axisblack]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot11.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot11.png)   

I would also like to use one of my favorite fonts for title and keep the other texts as it is. For that we need to load another package call `extrafont`. You have to load all the fonts available in your computer first(one time). Check the package detail for more info. Once you are done with the load, you can check the available fonts with **fonts()** function. I have also increased font size of axes texts and title. One line of code is added in order to run windows font.

```r
windowsFonts(MB=windowsFont("Mongolian Baiti")) ###
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .6, colour = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 11), ###
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11), ###
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, family = "Mongolian Baiti")) ###

```   

[![font]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot12.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot12.png)    

Because of extrafont package we can create XKCD style bar plot by loading xkcd font. Check out more info about [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com/).     

```r
windowsFonts(xkcd=windowsFont("xkcd")) ###
ggplot(attempts, aes(x = reorder(Name, Total.attempts), y = Total.attempts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lavender") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Total.attempts, family = "xkcd"), hjust = -0.2) + ###
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Total Attempts by Team in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Attempts") +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(size = .6, colour = "black"),
        axis.line.y = element_line(size = .6, colour = "black"), ###
        axis.text = element_text(size = 11),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, family = "xkcd"), ###
        text = element_text(family = "xkcd")) ###
```    

[![xkcd]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot13.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot13.png)      

We can do some popular themes as well like **FiveThirtyEight** and **The Economist**, but in order to resemble their bar plots, we need to load some paid fonts which I can't afford at the moment. So I will leave that out.     

**Stacked Bar Plot**    

Let's build a stacked bar plot which shows _On.target_, _Off.target_, _Blocked_. For this we need to change to data table into long format with `tidyr` package.     

Select only the variables which is required.  

```r
require(tidyr)

attempts <- select(attempts, Name, On.target, Off.target, Blocked)
attempts_long <- gather(attempts, "Result", "Value", 2:4)
```

Let's look at the first few lines of the new data.   

```r
head(attempts_long)
```          

| Name | Results | Value   
| ---  |---      |---   |
| France   |  On.target    |   43   |
| Wales   |  On.target     |    32  |
| Portugal   | On.target     |  39     |
| Belgium   | On.target    |    35     |
| Iceland   |  On.target   |    19   |
| Germany   | On.target     |    37     |  

So let's build the first stacked bar plot.    

```r
ggplot(attempts_long, aes(x = Name, y = Value, fill = Results)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```    

[![stacked]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot14.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot14.png)      

I have added title, y-axis title and left x-axis title as blank, changed the colour of the stacked bar and flipped the plot.    

```r
ggplot(attempts_long, aes(x = Name, y = Value, fill = Results)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Results of Attempts in EuroCup 2016") + ###
  labs(y = "Total Attempts", x = "") + ###
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue2", "lightblue3", "lightblue4")) + ###
  coord_flip() ###
```     

[![flipped]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot15.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot15.png)    

I prefer legend to be at the bottom and make the plot background as white with just horizontal-axis line.    

```r
ggplot(attempts_long, aes(x = Name, y = Value, fill = Results)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Results of Attempts in EuroCup 2016") +
  labs(y = "Total Attempts", x = "") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue2", "lightblue3", "lightblue4")) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal", ###
        legend.title = element_blank(),  ###
        panel.background = element_blank(), ###
        axis.line.x = element_line(size = .6, colour = "black")) ###
```    

[![legend]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot16.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/uefa2016/Rplot16.png)
