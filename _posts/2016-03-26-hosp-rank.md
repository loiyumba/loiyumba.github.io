On 29th January 2016, Times of India published a page on Hospital Ranking by Speciality titled "All India Critical Hospital Ranking Survey 2016". The moment I saw the page, I knew this will be good for shinyapp. So I made a shinyapp out of it. Well, I was busy with other things so couldn't make it until now. Like most of the shinyapps which is on free server, it's going to be slow. Have patience and play with the speciality options available to see your desire result.

On 31st August 2016, TOI published another list of hospitals rank on lifestyle hospital and clinic. I have added the new list in the app. This time the code link and raw data repo is shared in the app.     

Updated [app](https://loiyumba.shinyapps.io/hospital_ranking_2016/)    

Thanks for checking out the app.
