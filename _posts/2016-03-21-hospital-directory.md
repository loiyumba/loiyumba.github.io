In my free time, I like to check the free public data available online. Whenever I come across any interesting data, I download and explore 
the data. This is one data that I thought of giving filters and put it online for people to look for hospital information like address and
telephone numbers. The data is available [here](https://data.gov.in/catalog/hospital-directory-national-health-portal)

What could be best for an R junkie to give filters to data and put it online. The answer is shiny app. And shiny server host it online for
free. So I went ahead and put it online. Here's the [shinyapp](https://loiyumba.shinyapps.io/National_Hospital_Directory/) to explore 
hospital directory in India. Since the data is big, it is little slow to retrieve the data. Also, if the server is busy, it is again slow.
Have patience and the app will bring the data you are looking for.

The shiny app code is here
