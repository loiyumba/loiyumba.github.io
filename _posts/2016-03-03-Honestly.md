I have come across many sites build on github.io, and I thought this option is available only to those users who use private repository(paid repository). 
I came to know recently that this is actually free and all the credit goes to [this blog](http://deanattali.com/). Not just that, it also
helps to construct the site easily with few minimal steps. It's already readymade for everyone. The theme is what I exactly wanted. Even though the creator of the theme calls it "beautiful-jekyll", I would like to call it - the minimalist-jekyll! If you want to create similar free github page, you can start from [here](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)
