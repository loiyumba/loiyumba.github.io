I have come across many sites build on github.io, and I thought this option is available only to those users who uses private repository. 
I came to know recently that this is actually free and all the credit goes to [this blog](http://deanattali.com/). Not just that, it also
helped to construct the site easily with few minimal steps. It's already readymade for everyone. The theme is what I exactly wanted. Even though
the creator of the theme calls it "beautiful jekyll", I would like to call it - the minimalist one! I will be sharing whatever I feel like.
There's no specific aim that this blog is going to discuss one or few particular topics. It could be anything but mostly about my learning
experience of Data Science.  

I will be sharing more ...
