title: Major Earthquakes in Indian subcontinent
subtitle: Interactive map- Shiny app
---

We get data and the next thing is what can we do with it. We dig in and look for insights to get more detail. The most basic thing we can do
is to create a shiny app to explore the data online. This time I thought of creating an interactive map to explore earthquake data in the
Indian subcontinent. A user can select a year and see where all the major earthquakes occured in that particular year with information 
like magnitude and deaths. Data is extracted from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_India).

The shiny app is [here](https://loiyumba.shinyapps.io/india_quakes/)  
The R code is [here](https://gist.github.com/loiyumba/ba308734b7346f6b6269e9e4c88e6008)
